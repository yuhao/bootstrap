Computer architecture research has been largely driven by access and awareness
of infrastructures such as simulators and workload suites. Many computer
architecture domains such as GPUs and dataÂ­centers have mature infrastructures
that have been developed for years and are now widely adopted. The nature of
mobile research emphasizes real system study and measurement. However, we
currently lack systematic infrastructures that are easily accessible and widely
adopted. We see this as the major barrier of entry.

                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>

The tutorial is a step to overcome this increasing barrier.  We present a
series of tools and infrastructures that enable computer system and
architecture research in the mobile computing space.  The tutorial will span
three key components of mobile computing: software, hardware, and end-users.
The tools that we will cover strongly emphasize real system measurement,
including performance, power/energy, and user QoS experience.

                      that operate using energy extracted from their environment, even from low-power
                      sources like ambient radio-frequency energy. Future EHDs will be a key enabler
                      of emerging IoT applications, but today's EHDs operate intermittently, only as
                      environmental energy is available.  Unfortunately, intermittence makes today's
                      EHDs unreliable and extremely difficult to program.  In this talk I will
                      summarize the main challenges of intermittent execution.  I will then discuss
                      our recent efforts to develop future architecture, system, and toolchain
                      support for EHDs to address the challenges of intermittence, focusing
                      especially on programmability, debugging, and reliability.  I will close by
                      discussing our recent work on building a reliable, EHD-based, hardware/software

                        Do you have a mobile research tool you would like to
                        introduce to a broader audience? Apply to present it at
                        MobileTools! MobiTools invites mobile research tool
                        developers to give a thirty minute presentation about
                        their tool and how to conduct productive research with
                        it. An ideal presentation will briefly introduce the
                        tool and its underlying mechanisms and then walk the
                        audience through a (possibly hands on) "quickstart" tutorial.
